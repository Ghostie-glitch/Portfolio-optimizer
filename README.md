Using the shape ratio, the code can predict your portfolio's performance, provide you with an annual expected return, and suggest how you should divide up your stock holding percentages to get the best performance out of them. 


How to use it:
1)  For the code to work properly, you will most likely need to do a pip install to download the Yahoo Finance, fredapi, and Pretty Tables packages. Yahoo Finance will be the database from which the code pulls stock information, and the fred API will get the 10-year treasury rate, which will be used as a correction factor for inflation. 
2) Go to the following website to obtain your free API key and insert it into line 70 of the code. 
3) run the code and enjoy
